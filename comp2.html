  <h2>History of the Orchestra</h2>
  <p>Over a two-year period in the late nineties, Townsville musicians, arts workers and a group of people who had a love for music realised the potential for developing a community-based Orchestra — <b>one that would flourish and become an integral part of the City’s cultural life.</b> 
    <br><br>
    In 2000 to ‘test’ the viability of establishing an Orchestra a weekend workshop was arranged and musicians were invited to participate under the baton of Richard McIntyre, Senior Lecturer at the Canberra School of Music and the result — the Barrier Reef Orchestra was born. 
    During the past few years, the Orchestra has performed with the comedy-duo <i>Scared Weird Little Guys</i> in Score, Townsville City Council’s <i>Last Night of the Proms</i> and <i>A Christmas Carol</i>. In 2003 the Council’s centenary year the Orchestra took part in Encore, as well as playing a major role in the Townsville Civic Theatre’s 25th Anniversary productions of Noye’s Fludde and Carmina Burana. 
    <br><br>
    In a typical year the Barrier Reef Orchestra, under the auspices of North Queensland Ensembles Inc, performs three times generally with a guest conductor and occasionally with other performing groups. Smaller ensembles, all utilising players from the Orchestra, regularly give concerts — <i>Orpheus Strings, Pandanus Winds, Kingfisher Trio, Centenary Concert Band and the Barrier Reef Chamber Orchestra</i>. In 2004, the Orchestra presented its first subscription series of three concerts receiving sponsorship from Queensland Nickel – Yabulu. 
    <br><br>
    The high standard is due in no small measure to the guidance and inspiration of our founding Patron, Professor John Hopkins OBE and conductor Richard McIntyre OAM. 
    <br><br>
    In 2006 the orchestra became a truly North Queensland orchestra when in March a number of string players from Cairns travelled to Townsville to rehearse under <i>Professor Hopkins</i> for the planned Tchaikovsky concert. Unfortunately, the interruption of Cyclone Larry prevented the repeat performance scheduled for Cairns. 
    <br><br>
  The final concert for 2006 , <i>‘Amadeus’</i>, celebrated the life of this great composer in his 250th anniversary year. The Barrier Reef Orchestra could think of <b>no better way in which to celebrate their sixth anniversary!</b></p>

  <h3>2007</h3>
  <p>In 2007 BRO performed the Beethoven Triple Concerto with visiting Seraphim Trio from Melbourne. The orchestra repeated the concert in Cairns with no Cyclone Larry this time! 
    <br><br>
    A string ensemble drawn from the larger orchestra was invited by Piers Lane the new Director of the AFCM, to perform for the first time in the Australian Festival of Chamber Music, accompanying Australian Opera Baritone Peter Coleman-Wright, a very successful concert. 
    <br><br>
  The Governor of Queensland became the patron of the Orchestra joining the founding patron Professor John Hopkins to inspire the further development of the orchestra and the year culminated in a sell out concert featuring James Morrison, conductor Sean O"Boyle, jazz vocalist Emma Pask and a collaboration with Townsville Brass and the rythym section from the amazing 1 RAR Band. The event of the year! </p>

  <h3>2008</h3>
  <p>In 2008 this last concert generated an award from the Townsville City Council as "Best Musical Event 2007" and after a mammoth launch at the Townsville City CouncilChambers the year began with a concert under the baton of visiting UK conductor Mark Eager. This was a collaboration with a combined High Schools orchestra and demonstrated the depth of musical talent flowing up from the district's excellent Instrumental Music programs. The concert culminated in BRO combining with the high school orchestra for a stirring 1812 Overture! 
    <br><br>
    Then followed a terrific concert featuring Matthew Rigby, the 2007 winner of the North Queensland Concerto and Vocal Competition, conducted by John Hopkins OBE, continuing a fruitful collboration promoting young rising musicians. 
    <br><br>
    This was closely followed by a 2008 performance at the AFCM with the orchestra ensemble playing a Carl Vine composition "The Battlers" which was conducted by the composer. 
    <br><br>
    Also at this occasion the orchestra accompanied Innisfail-born, London-based concert pianist Piers Lane. The orchestra greatly appreciates such opportunities to perform alongside such inspiring artists. 
    <br><br>
    Conductor Richard McIntyre returned with rising Oboist Megan Billing and BRO to perform in Slavonic Swoon, featuring works by Dvorak, Smetana and Martinu. 
    <br><br>
  2008 culminated in the return of Sean O'Boyle who brought with him James Morrison, Emma Pask and Catherine Lynagh (Qld Piano Competition winner) and another collaboration with 1RAR musicians. </p>

  <h3>2009</h3>
  <p><b>The Barrier Reef Orchestra proudly announced that Her Excellency, the Governor of Queensland Penelope Wensley agreed to be patron of our orchestra.</b> 
    <br><br>
    2009 was a year of highs and lows for the Barrier Reef Orchestra...
    Our first concert in March was conducted by Richard McIntyre but we had pre-concert drama as our soloist had to retire due to injury. We fortunately were able to get Marcus Stocker at the last minute to play the Dvorak concerto. The program of Dvorak and Sibelius challenged the orchestra but the challenge and drama became greater due to the failure of the airconditioning at Riverway. 
    <br><br>
    With the venue getting hotter and hotter during rehearsal we had to decide whether to go ahead or cancel the event. We decided to go ahead and most of our loyal audience stayed with us but it was hard going. Rick who is from cold Canberra certainly got a feel of the tropics that night as did everyone that attended. 
    <br><br>
    Our mid year concert had to be cancelled due to the majority of the orchestra going away for a music camp. Very few cities the size of Townsville attempt to produce an orchestra and while Townsville is musically very strong we certainly stretched the music fraternity too far at that time. 
    <br><br>
    Our October concert was to feature Ji Won Kim who had won the previous Australian Vocal and Concerto Competition here in Townsville. However, her blossoming career had her overseas at the time, and made her unavailable for that concert. She has since gone on to win the ABC’s Young Performer of the Year Award. We now look forward to hearing her play in our next concert in March 2010. 
    <br><br>
  Our guest conductor Sean O’Boyle knew the perfect singers to do a “Last Night at the Proms” concert. This concert was a great success! It featured the Townsville Oratorio Choir, the full orchestra, Sean O’Boyle conducting and also included guest piper, Ray Sutton, guest tenor, Gregory Moore and Canadian soprano, Suzanne Kompass at the Civic Theatre.</p>
