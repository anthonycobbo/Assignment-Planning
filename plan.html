<h1>CP1406 Assignment 2</h1>
<h2>Project Plan Name: Barrier Reef Orchestra Site Redevelopment</h2>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To design a website that will increase the size of the audience and audience feedback, as well as increase the support of the orchestra through donations and sponsors.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>The client hasn't expressed a specific target to aim towards, however, success can be evaluated based on increases in audience size after the website has been developed. Also, an increase in audience feedback sent through the site as well as any increase in donations or sponsors can be used to determine the site's success </p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Currently, the audience consists of an older demographric, however, the client expressed interest in attracting a younger audience. Therefore a target demographic of men and women aged 12-30 would be appropriate. This can be achieved by changing the designs and layout of the webpages to make them more aesthetic to a younger demographic. The  client would like a 'spunky' design and wants the websites theme colours to represent the reef. Therefore a colour scheme of blues and yellows will be applied to attract a younger demographic. The redesign of the website will change the text to be less overwhelming by breaking it up and applying neater text layouts, by doing so the site can cater towards the demographic of men and women aged 12-30.</p>
